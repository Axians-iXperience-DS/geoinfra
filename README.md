Working with Axiansâ€™ Location Intelligence Team, we developed algorithms using satellite images to determine whether vegetation growth will interfere with power line construction. This will involve using machine learning to identify and monitor power lines, geographical features, obstructions and other changes in the landscape. This project will involve a lot of Random Forest based ensemble methods and segmentation to do pixel-based classification.
